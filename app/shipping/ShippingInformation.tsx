        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">‚ùó What You MUST Know Before Signing for Delivery</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Before you sign the delivery slip</strong>, thoroughly inspect the <strong>outer packaging and box</strong> for any dents, holes, tears, crushed corners, or signs of water damage.
            Do this while the driver is still present.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please understand: <strong>you are not allowed to open the package</strong> before signing. The inspection must be external only.
            Once you sign, it indicates you accept the item in its current visible condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see any visible signs of damage ‚Äî even if you think it's minor ‚Äî <strong>do not sign without noting the damage clearly on the delivery receipt</strong>.
            For example: ‚ÄúBox crushed on corner, possible internal damage.‚Äù
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Never sign 'Received in good condition'</strong> unless you are 100% sure there are no damages visible externally.
            Signing without comments waives your right to claim compensation from the freight carrier.
          </li>
          <li>
            DriveCore Auto <strong>is not responsible for shipping-related damages</strong>. Once the product leaves our facility,
            insurance coverage is managed by the freight carrier. If you fail to note issues at delivery, you forfeit the right to file a damage claim.
